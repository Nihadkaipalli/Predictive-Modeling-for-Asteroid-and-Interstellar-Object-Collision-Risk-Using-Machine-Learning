## **Interpretability**

Understanding model predictions is critical for a high-stakes application like asteroid collision risk prediction. This project employs **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** to:

1. Explain individual predictions:
   - Identify the most influential features for each prediction.
   - Visualize their impact (positive or negative) on the predicted probability.

2. Perform batch analysis:
   - Analyze multiple test samples to understand overall model behavior.

3. Test edge cases using Monte Carlo simulations:
   - Explore robustness in scenarios like high eccentricity, extreme velocities, and Earth proximity.

**Edge Case Analysis**:
Predictions under conditions such as:
- **Extreme Eccentricity**: Highly elliptical orbits.
- **Proximity to Earth**: Near-collision scenarios with `q` close to zero.
- **High Orbital Velocity**: Unusually fast-moving asteroids.

## **Results**

### **Key Takeaways**:
- Models achieved **high accuracy and recall**, critical for identifying high-risk scenarios.
- **Feature Importance**:
  - The most influential features include:
    - `q` (Perihelion distance)
    - `neo` (Near-Earth Object flag)
    - `H` (Absolute Magnitude).
- Models demonstrated robustness across extreme edge cases.

### **Visual Highlights**:
- **ROC Curves**: Demonstrates near-perfect performance for all models.
